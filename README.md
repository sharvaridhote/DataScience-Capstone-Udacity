## Motivation

The businesses want to target right customers throughout the customer journey which helps to reduce the marketing budget, customer satisfaction as well increase the profits.  Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are helping automate the digital marketing with real time decision making such as selecting best messaging platform, best timing, and the best offering to the individual customer by integrating data from different platforms.

Udacity's Starbucks Capstone challenge project data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Machine learning technique will be used in order to develop effective marketing strategy for the Starbucks business using the available data.
