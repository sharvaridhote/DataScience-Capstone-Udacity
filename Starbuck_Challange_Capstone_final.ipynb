    "\n",
    "The businesses want to target right customers throughout the customer journey which helps to reduce the marketing budget, customer satisfaction as well increase the profits.  Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are helping automate the digital marketing with real time decision making such as selecting best messaging platform, best timing, and the best offering to the individual customer by integrating data from different platforms \\cite{linkedin,digitalmarketinginstitute,urbancursor,medium}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity's Starbucks Capstone challenge project  data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Machine learning technique will be used in order to develop effective marketing strategy for the Starbucks business using the available data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app every few days. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). The given dataset contains demographic data a record of transaction and details about offer information. Before developing a predictive model, exploratory data analysis and customer segmentation will be carried out which will help Starbucks business in better targeted marketing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\textit{It is important to know your customers in order to increase business. First, customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning technique K-means clustering will be carried out to understand current customer characteristics and demographics. Second  the best performing supervised machine learning model will be build by comparing random forest and boosting ensemble models performance based on the defined metrics to predict if customer will respond to an offer or not for better targeted marketing. }\n",

    "# Project Design \n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the project design steps carried out to execute this project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I \n",
    "- Data Exploration & : First step is to know the data. Matplotlib/Seaborn/plotly libraries will be used for the exploratory data analysis (EDA). Study the data statistic, count missing values, plot different variables and understand and explore the data.\n",
    "- Model pre-processing and cleaning : Basic cleaning steps such as filling missing, checking outliers, dropping unimportant and duplicate columns, Encoding categorical variables..\n",
    "## Part II\n",
    " Data Wranglling -  scaling, and feature engineering. \n",
    "## Part II\n",
    "- Next, customer segmentation will be carried out to group the demographic and purchase data.  \n",
    "- Train and Test data : Labeled dataset will be prepared and split randomly to train and test dataset. \n",
    "## Part III\n",
    "- Model training and implementation : Five different models will be implemented and based on the AUC value and other metrics, best model will be selected. \n",
    "- Model validation : Test data will be used to validate the model performance with defined metrics. \n",
    "- Model selection and optimization : Selected model will be tuned using a grid search. \n",
    "    \n",
    "# Challanges \n",
    "\n",
    "- Not all users receive the same offer\n",
    "- Different validity period the offer type and informational offer to influence customer.\n",
    "- Customer might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer\n",
    "- A user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer\n"
